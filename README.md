# VPN Setup Project

🌟 Excited to Announce My Latest Project on VPN Setup! 🌟

I recently completed a project where I created my own Virtual Private Network (VPN) server using Amazon EC2 t2.medium instances and OpenVPN. This project has been a significant step in my journey as an aspiring DevOps Engineer, enhancing my skills in network security and cloud computing.

## Project Description

The objective of this project was to establish a secure and private internet connection through a VPN server. Here’s a detailed breakdown of the steps involved in setting up the VPN:

### Steps to Create the VPN Server

1. **Launch EC2 Instance:**
   - Deployed an Amazon EC2 t2.medium instance from the AWS Management Console.
   - Selected the OpenVPN Access Server from the AWS Marketplace for easy deployment.

2. **Install OpenVPN:**
   - Launched the OpenVPN Access Server instance and connected to it via SSH.
   - Followed the installation instructions provided by OpenVPN to complete the setup.

3. **Create Admin Account:**
   - Accessed the OpenVPN Admin Web UI using the instance's public IP address.
   - Created an admin account for managing VPN users and settings.

4. **Configure VPN Settings:**
   - Configured network settings, user permissions, and security protocols through the Admin Web UI.
   - Ensured that all data transmissions between clients and the server were encrypted.

5. **Connect to VPN:**
   - Generated client configuration files using the Admin Web UI.
   - Downloaded and installed the OpenVPN client on my local machine.
   - Imported the configuration files into the OpenVPN client and successfully connected to the VPN server.

## Resources Used

- **Amazon EC2 t2.medium:** For hosting the VPN server.
- **OpenVPN Access Server:** For creating and managing the VPN.
